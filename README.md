I am a **full-stack junior developer**, currently studying at Makers Academy & graduating October 2018.

After 5 years trading equities & derivatives, I started a social finance consultancy – Cortex – to help address major social issues by structuring & implementing impact investments.  Before Makers, having studied AutoCAD at night school, I spent 18 months designing, demolishing & then rebuilding a house in Peckham.  

My ambition now is to forge a career in software design & engineering.  I am looking for opportunities in London to work on interesting projects in effective teams.

**Tech Skill Set**: Ruby, JavaScript, jQuery, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Node & React

## Skills

### Excellent communicator

Managing Cortex required consistently high standards of communication. Before this, during my time at Merrill Lynch, I wrote and distributed daily newsletters to my clients including market commentary and data analysis.  I also chaired the morning meeting of 10-15 sales-traders in London and 15-20 in New York.

After a number of leadership roles at school, I graetly enjoyed honing my communication skills when I became a qualified TEFL teacher.  Frequently in my career, I have enjoyed and thrived when making technical concepts accessible.  Whether written or verbal, in pairs or as a group, listening and communicating efficiently is at the core of our journey at Makers Academy & I look forward to bringing these skills to my next role.

- Leadership roles
- Qualified teacher


### Team Player

One of the things I really love about programming is tight teams - pairing and solving problems together.  Above all, I would like to think that I can fit well within a group and contribute to an enjoyable, healthy, positive working environment.  I have the ability to find what is exciting in a project and bring this enthusiasm to the whole team.  

- Lots of 'Team Player' stickers. Mentored juniors & helped shape future iterations of the course
- Head of House, Captain of Football, Captain of British Universities Cricket


### Growth mindset

At Makers we have to pick up new concepts quickly. A precursor to this is the willingness to grow and embrace challenges. At times, it can feel overwhelming but we are fortunate to be trained with tools and methodologies to effectively manage these aspects of development and maintain wellbeing, individually and as a group.

The emotional curriculum should not be underestimated.  I am proud to have more mastery of my emotions and consider these skills as very much part of my growth mindset - empathy, listening, teaching, strong pairing skills, team work, shared learning and enhanced problem solving.
